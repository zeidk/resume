\cvsection{Research Interest}
Agile assembly for manufacturing. The key idea for this research project is to develop the measurement science, in the form of an integrated agility framework, which will enable manufacturers to assess and assure the agility performance of their robot systems. This framework includes robot agility performance metrics, information models, test methods, and protocols.
