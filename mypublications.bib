	that provides added agility by detecting and correcting action failures.
	The system also provides for late binding of action parameters, thus
	providing flexibility by allowing plans to adapt to changing environmental

	Kitting, the process of building kits, has not yet been automated
	in many industries where automation may be feasible. Consequently,
	the cost of building kits is higher than it could be. We are addressing
	this problem by building models of the knowledge that will be required
	to operate an automated kitting workstation. A first pass has been
	made at modeling non-executable information about a kitting workstation
	that will be needed, such as information about a robot, parts, kit
	designs, grippers, etc. A model (or models) of executable plans for
	building kits is also needed. The plans will be used by execution
	systems that control robots and other mechanical devices to build
	kits. The first steps in building a kitting plan model are to determine
	what the functional requirements are and what model constructs are
	needed to enable meeting those requirements. This paper discusses
	those issues.},

  abstract = {This paper describes PRIDE (Prediction in Dynamic Environments), a
	multi-resolution and hierarchical framework. PRIDE was developed
	as a test bed to assess the performance of autonomous vehicles in
	the presence of moving objects in a simulated environment. By simulating
	scenarios in which moving objects are prevalent, a designer of an
	autonomous vehicle can test the performance of their path planning
	and collision avoidance algorithms without having to immerse the
	vehicle in the physical world. This framework supports the prediction
	of the future location of moving objects at various levels of resolution,
	thus providing prediction information at the frequency and level
	of abstraction necessary for planners at different levels within
	the hierarchy.
	
	Previous works have demonstrated the reliability of PRIDE to simulate
	on-road traffic situations with multiple vehicles. To provide realistic
	scenarios, PRIDE integrates a level of situation awareness of how
	other vehicles in the environment are expected to behave considering
	the situation in which the vehicles find themselves in.
	
	
	In recent efforts, the PRIDE framework has been extended to consider
	production logistics in dynamic manufacturing environment while focusing
	on the scheduling of material transportation system. To demonstrate
	the characteristics of the PRIDE framework, this paper illustrates
	real-time navigation of Automated Guided Vehicles (AGVs) at different
	locations in a dynamic manufacturing environment. Moreover, using
	the high-fidelity physics-based framework for the Unified System
	for Automation and Robot Simulation (USARSim), this paper analyzes
	the performance of the PRIDE framework on a set of realistic scenarios.},

	in the presence of static and moving objects. Based on sensed data
	of the environment and the current traffic situation, an autonomous
	vehicle has to plan a path by predicting the future location of objects
	of interest. In this context, an object of interest is a moving or
	stationary object in the environment that has a reasonable probability

	time frame. This paper investigates the identification of objects
	of interest within the PRIDE (PRediction In Dynamic Environments)

	that predicts the future location of moving objects for the purposes
	of path planning and collision avoidance for an autonomous vehicle.
	Identifying objects of interest is an aspect of situation awareness
	and is performed in PRIDE using a dangerous zone, i.e., a fuzzy-logic-based
	approach representing a hazardous space area around an autonomous
	vehicle. Once objects of interest are identified, the risk of collision

	multi-resolution and hierarchical framework. PRIDE was developed
	as a test bed to assess the performance of autonomous vehicles in

	scenarios in which moving objects are prevalent, a designer of an
	autonomous vehicle can test the performance of their path planning
	and collision avoidance algorithms without having to immerse the
	vehicle in the physical world. This framework supports the prediction
	of the future location of moving objects at various levels of resolution,
	thus providing prediction information at the frequency and level
	of abstraction necessary for planners at different levels within
	the hierarchy.
	
	Previous works have demonstrated the reliability of PRIDE to simulate
	on-road traffic situations with multiple vehicles. To provide realistic
	scenarios, PRIDE integrates a level of situation awareness of how
	other vehicles in the environment are expected to behave considering
	the situation in which the vehicles find themselves in.
	
	
	In recent efforts, the PRIDE framework has been extended to consider
	production logistics in dynamic manufacturing environment while focusing
	on the scheduling of material transportation system. To demonstrate
	the characteristics of the PRIDE framework, this paper illustrates
	real-time navigation of Automated Guided Vehicles (AGVs) at different

	approach representing a hazardous space area around an autonomous
	vehicle. Once objects of interest are identified, the risk of collision

	necessary for planners at different levels within the hierarchy.
	This paper presents the results from research exploring the integration
	of these two prediction approaches in a way that the predictions
	from one can help to enforce the predictions of the other. We propose
	a methodology at which the short-term prediction algorithm no longer
	provides results within an acceptable predefined error threshold.
	We identify the different time periods where the two algorithms provide
	better estimates and thus demonstrate the ability to use the results
	of the short-term prediction algorithm to strengthen/weaken the estimates
	of the long-term prediction algorithm at different time periods.
	We provide experimental results in an autonomous on-road driving
	scenario on a closed-track for different cases using AutoSim, a highfidelity
	simulation tool that models details about road networks, including
	individual lanes, lane markings, intersections, legal intersection
	traversability, etc.},

	high-fidelity physics-based framework for the Unified System for

	when programmed using the teach- and-playback method. While effective,
	this method requires significant up-front time, tying up the robot
	and a person during the teaching phase. Off-line programming can
	be used to generate robot programs, but the accuracy of this method
	is poor unless supplemented with good calibration to remove systematic
	errors, feed-forward models to anticipate robot response to loads,
	and sensing to compensate for unmodeled errors. These increase the
	complexity and up-front cost of the system, but the payback in the
	reduction of recurring teach programming time can be worth the effort.
	This payback especially benefits small-batch, short-turnaround applications
	typical of small- to-medium enterprises, who need the agility afforded
	by off- line application development to be competitive against low-cost
	manual labor. To fully benefit from this agile application tasking
	model, a common representation of tasks should be used that is understood

	and people. This paper describes an information model, the Canonical
